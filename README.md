# FAQ

**Q:** How do I use it?

**A:** Install the extension, open in Visual Studio a local file coming from any Azure DevOps, GitHub or GitLab repository. No need to open an entire solution, just a document is enough. Then, use one of the menu showed above to copy a link.


**Q:** Can I share a link from any branch?

**A:** Yes, as long as what you're trying to share exists online (so make sure the code or file you share has been pushed on the current branch).


**Q:** What if I want to share a local change?

**A:** You need to Push the change first.


**Q:** What if I share a code existing in, let’s say, Master branch on the remote repository, but that I’m on a local branch that isn’t pushed yet?

**A:** If your branch doesn’t exist online, it will generate a link using the default branch on the remote repository (commonly Master).
    But of course if your local branch differs too much from the default remote one, the link may be inaccurate.
    
**Q:** Does it works from a Live Share guest session, or GitHub Codespaces session?

**A:** No.

**Q:** Can i share GitLab link ?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** Can i share entreprise self-managed github or gitlab link ?

**A:** Yes.
